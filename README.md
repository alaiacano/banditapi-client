I created an API for running website tests using bandit algorithms. There is much more info at [http://banditapi.herokuapp.com](http://banditapi.herokuapp.com). This is a python client library for accessing the API.

Features that work so far:

* getting info on a running test
* selecting an arm to display
* updating the algorithm with the test results

Features that haven't been implemented yet:

* create a new test
